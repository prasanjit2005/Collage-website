    <h2>History of the Institution</h2>
    <p>
      Biswanath College was founded on September 7, 1960, through the concerted efforts of visionary local leaders, academicians, and dedicated community members who understood the transformative power of education in rural Assam. The college’s name is drawn from the historic Biswanath Temple, symbolizing its deep cultural roots and connection to local heritage. Situated on the north bank of the Brahmaputra in Sonitpur district, the college occupies a region rich in natural and historical significance, with its location bounded by the rivers Borgang and Ghiladhari and the Himalayas to the north.

      In its early years, Biswanath College operated in the then undivided Darrang District, which lacked higher education facilities at the time, making its establishment crucial for the educational upliftment of rural and semi-urban populations. Notable individuals like Naazibur Rahman, the executive engineer in the PWD department, played a leading role in its foundation. Under the guidance of principled leadership, such as Principal Sadananda Chaliha, the college rapidly grew, gaining recognition for academic excellence and for breaking new ground in educational standards and inclusivity.

      Over its six-decade history, Biswanath College has evolved into a distinguished institution affiliated with Gauhati University, introducing the science faculty in 1970 and expanding with various arts, science, and commerce disciplines. The college was brought under deficit-grant-in-aid by the Government of Assam on April 1, 1963, marking the start of a new era of educational growth and stability. It established robust departments, such as History and Assamese, right from its inception, laying the foundation for later postgraduate programs and excellence in teaching and research.

      Today, Biswanath College serves as a vibrant center for academic, cultural, and social activities, with a strong commitment to serving the community through initiatives like literacy campaigns, health awareness programs, and skill development workshops. Its legacy is further enriched by a network of accomplished alumni and by its ongoing efforts to foster innovation, global collaboration, and sustainable academic practices.

      <p>
        It is my pleasure to welcome you all to one of the oldest institutions of higher education of the north bank of the river Brahmaputra. Biswanath College which is Assam’s leading premier Institution has set specific objectives and planned activities for achieving excellence in all spheres of education. The laboratories, classrooms etc have been designed as per the needs of the students. There are also good collection of reference
        books, textbooks and journals to cater to the various academic needs. For holistic development of students, we organise Guest Lectures, Industrial Expert talks, Workshops, Seminars and various Training programmes along with mandatory university prescribed syllabus. Our aim is to prepare academically rich and professionally competent students who can contribute in building up a self-reliant India in the coming times. In addition to the academics, the students are engaged in sports and cultural activities too in order to provide a healthy relief from rigorous routine. With experienced and dedicated faculties as well as excellent infrastructure, our college helps students to realise their goals in life. Our sincere staff deserves all the credit of our success year after year. I encourage all the students to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the college and involve themselves in all the extracurricular activities by availing of the sports ground, gymnasium, training on cultural activities
        provided by the college. The college completed sixty three years of its glorious existence in 2023 and it gives me pleasure to make a special mention that the United Nations Academic Impact offered membership citation to our college during the year of celebration of Diamond Jubilee of the college. As we step into the new academic session, filled with hope and dreams of soaring new heights, I wish to reiterate the importance of a few things that students need to keep in mind. Remember hard work, dedication and perseverance are the most important traits in a person that leads to success in life. The future belongs to you; your need, therefore, is to prepare yourself for an active participation in the world. Learn to enjoy hard work, particularly your studies. Think wisely, think systematically. Always keep in mind the importance of planning and prioritizing your time and the effective use of it which are essential to achieve success. Preserve our heritage and environment for yourself as well as for your next generation. Be a good human being above all. Parents should remember that children should not be forced, but should be guided to achieve whatever goals they may have in their minds in an easy and pleasing manner, so that we may be able to discover the particular touch of genius in each one of them. Personally, I am grateful and elated to continue this journey with you as your Principal. Over the past four years, I have had a chance to meet many of you and your parents, and look forward to continuing building a strong relationship with all of you in the times ahead!

        <br><br>Happy Learning!!!
